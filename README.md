The Nodes are the cities, edges are the two-way roads. If there is no possible path between two cities, then they are said to be in different states. There is a tax system here. If you want to travel from one state to another, you will be charged 1$.
There is no tax charge if you wish to visit a city within the same state.
# Question 1:
**What is the minimum number of dollars that Lenna need to carry to reach all the cities in the country?**

My Solution - 100% accuracy (10000 test images were given)

# Question 2:
**What is the maximum number of cities that Lenna can visit with just 1$?**

My solution - 94.4% accuracy (same 10000 test images were given)
